      <description>Scott Frost and Fred Hoiberg have had an interesting few years as head coaches at the University of Nebraska. Frost, who just finished his fourth year as the coach of Nebraska Football, now carries a 15-29 record in his Nebraska career. On the other hand, Fred Hoiberg, now holds a 19-48 record as he has just begun his third season as the head coach of Nebraska Basketball.

Spectators at golf tournaments can have a major part in the outcome and atmosphere of a tournament.</description>
